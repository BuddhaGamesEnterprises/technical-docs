## Exchanges

An exchange intending to list ada can use a series of components, depending on whether the exchange wants to run a local block explorer with **specific APIs** or **custom APIs**.

**Running local block explorers with specific APIs**

If the exchange intends to run a local block explorer with *specific* APIs, they can use the following components:

-   cardano-node
-   cardano-db-sync
-   Postgresql DB
-   cardano-rest

**Running local block explorers with custom APIs**

If the exchange intends to run a local block explorer with *custom* APIs, they can use the following components:

-   cardano-node
-   cardano-db-sync
-   Postgresql DB
-   cardano-graphql  
-   cardano-node
-   cardano-wallet

### Adrestia Haskell SDK libraries###

These libraries enable exchanges to create their own wallet and manage coin selection, address generation with serialization. The libraries are particularly useful for exchanges who want more control over UTXOs.

-   cardano-coin-selection
-   cardano-addresses
-   cardano-transactions
-   cardano-serialization-lib
-   bech32
