# Getting Support

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano. We have a dedicated [support desk](https://iohk.zendesk.com/) with a library of articles to help you with your issues and questions. 

To contact IOHK Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
