## Stake pool metadata

In addition to posting a registration certificate to the blockchain, setting up a stake pool for delegation also involves the provision of metadata, (additional information about the pool).

The registration certificate contains all the necessary information for the execution of the protocol (public key hashes, cost, margin, relays, and pledge), and also contains a hash of the metadata.

If metadata is provided, the end users' wallet will display the stake pool. If metadata is not supplied, the stake pool is considered private, and will not be displayed in a user's wallet.
