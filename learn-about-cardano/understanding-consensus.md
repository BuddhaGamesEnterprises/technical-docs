## Understanding consensus

Consensus is the process by which a majority opinion is reached by everyone who is involved in running the blockchain. Agreement must be made on which blocks to produce, which chain to adopt, and to determine the single state of the network. The blocks that are made determine the state of the ledger - which transactions are confirmed, as well as account balance details.

In a cryptocurrency, agreement must be made by the participants on which transactions have happened on the blockchain — the history of the ledger — which also determines who owns how much money now. Blockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions that others have submitted to the system in “blocks”, and adding them to their “chain” (sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block when, and what to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding different blocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the different consensus protocols

The consensus protocol has three main responsibilities; to perform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced, to handle chain selection, and to verify blocks that are produced.
